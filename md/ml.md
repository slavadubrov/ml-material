## Directions

+++
@title[Supervised]

* **Supervised learning** problems - applications in which the training data comprises examples of the input vectors along with their corresponding target vectors
<span style="font-size:0.8em">
    * Classification
    * Regression
</span>

+++
@title[Unsupervised]

* **Unsupervised learning** problems - the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values
<span style="font-size:0.8em">
    * Clustering
    * Density estimation
    * Dimensionality reduction
    * Anomaly detection
</span>

+++
@title[Reinforcement learning]

* **Reinforcement learning** is concerned with the problem of finding suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward
<span style="font-size:0.8em">
    * Here the learning algorithm is not given examples of optimal outputs, in contrast to supervised learning, but must instead discover them by a process of trial and error.
    * Typically there is a sequence of states and actions in which the learning algorithm is interacting with its environment.

@title[Recommender systems]

* **Recommender systems**  estimate a utility function that automatically predicts how a user will like an item. Based on:

    * Past behavior
    * Relations to other users
    * Item similarity
    * Context

@title[Classification]

* **Classification**
	* The aim is to assign each input vector to one of a finite number of discrete categories
		* Example: the digit recognition

* **Regression**
	* The aim is to predict for each input vector some continuous variable
		* Example: price of the apartments prediction
