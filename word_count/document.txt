Lie awake in bed at night 
And think about your life 
Do you want to be different? 
Try to let go of the truth 
The battles of your youth 
'Cause this is just a game 

It's a beautiful lie 
It's the perfect denial 
Such a beautiful lie to believe in 
So beautiful, beautiful it makes me 

It's time to forget about the past 
To wash away what happened last 
Hide behind an empty face 
Don't ask too much, just say 
'Cause this is just a game 

Everyone's looking at me 
I'm running around in circles, baby 
A quiet desperation's building higher 
I've got to remember this is just a game 

So beautiful, beautiful...

Won't suffer, be broken, get tired, or wasted 
Surrender to nothing, or give up what I 
Started and stopped it, from end to beginning 
A new day is coming, and I am finally free 

Run away, run away, I'll attack 
Run away, run away, go chase yourself 
Run away, run away, now I'll attack 
I'll attack, I'll aa-WHOOOAAAAAAAAA 
I would have kept you, forever, but we had to sever 
It ended for both of us, faster than a 
Kill off this thinking, it's starting to sink in 
I'm losing control now, and without you I can finally see 

Run away, run away, I'll attack 
Run away, run away, go change yourself 
Run away, run away, now I'll attack 
I'll attack, I'll aa-WHOOOAAAAAAAAA 

Your promises, they look like lies 
Your honesty, like a back that hides a knife (knife) 
I promise you (promise you) 
I promise you (promise you) 
And I am finally free 

Run away, run away, I'll attack 
Run away, run away, go change yourself 
Run away, run away, now I'll attack 
I'll attack, I'll attack, I will attack 

Run away, I'll attack, I will attack 
Run away, I'll attack, I will attack 

Run away (Run away), I'll attack (I'll attack) 
I'll aa-WHOOOAAAAAAAAA 

Your promises 
(promises, promises) 
I promise you 
(promise you) 
I promise you 
(promise you, promise you)


I don't remember the moment, I tried to forget 
I lost myself, is it better not said 
Now I’m closer to the edge 

It was a thousand and one 
And a million to two ton gold 
Flames have taken you 
Closer to the edge 

No, I'm not saying I’m sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again 
No, I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again 
NO NO NO NO 

Can you imagine a time when the truth ran free 
The birth of us all and the death of a dream 
Closer to the edge 

This never ending story 
Paid for with pride and faith 
We all fall short of glory 
LOST IN THE SUN 

No, I'm not saying I’m sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again 
No, I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again 
NO NO NO NO 

NO NO NO NO 
I will never forget 
NO NO 
I will never regret 
NO NO 
I WILL LIVE MY LIFE 
NO NO NO NO 
I will never forget 
NO NO 
I will never regret 
NO NO 
I WILL LIVE MY LIFE 

No, I'm not saying I’m sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again 
No, I'm not saying I'm sorry 
One day maybe we'll meet again 
NO NO NO NO 


Closer to the edge 
Closer to the edge 
NO NO NO NO 

Closer to the edge 
Closer to the edge 
NO NO NO NO 

Closer to the edge


He's a stranger to some 
And a vision to none 
He can never get enough, 
Get enough of the one 

For a fortune he'd quit 
But it's hard to admit 
How it ends and begins 
On his face is a map of the world 
(A map of the world) 
On his face is a map of the world 
(A map of the world) 
From yesterday, it's coming! 
From yesterday, the fear! 
From yesterday, it calls him 
But he doesn't want to read the message here 

On a mountain he sits, not of gold but of shit 
Through the blood he can learn, see the life that it turn 
From council of one 
He'll decide when he's done with the innocent 

On his face is a map of the world 
(A map of the world) 
On his face is a map of the world 
(A map of the world) 

From yesterday, it's coming! 
From yesterday, the fear! 
From yesterday, it calls him 
But he doesn't want to read the message here 
But he doesn't want to read the message here 
But he doesn't want to read the message here 

On his face is a map of the world 

From yesterday, it's coming! 
From yesterday, the fear! 
From yesterday, it calls him 
But he doesn't want to read the message here 
From yesterday, 
From yesterday, 
From yesterday, the fear 
From yesterday, 
From yesterday 
But he doesn't want to read the message here 
But he doesn't want to read the message here 
But he doesn't want to read the message here


No matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights did you lie wide awake to the sound of the pausing rain
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?

Heart beat, a heart beat, I need a heart beat

Tell me would you kill to save your life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

No matter how many deaths that I die, I will never forget
No matter how many lies that I live, I will never regret
There is a fire inside that has started a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God?
Where is your God?
Where is your God?

Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to torture for my sins?

A heart beat, a heart beat, I need a heart beat
You know I gotta leave, I can't stay, I know I gotta go, I can't stay

Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to live a lie?

You say you wrong, you wrong, I'm right, I'm right, you're wrong, we fight
Ok, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night
Oh, the quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try, it's too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe, let it fly, let it go
Let it fall, let it crash, burn slow
And then you call upon God
ohhh, You call upon God

Oh Oh woah
This Hurricane
Oh Oh woah
This Hurricane
Oh Oh woah
This Hurricane

Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to torture for my sins?

Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to live a lie

Running away from the light, running away from the light.
